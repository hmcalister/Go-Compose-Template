# Go Docker Compose Template

An architecture template for an app using Golang. The server uses the Chi router to handle requests. Postgres is used for the database. SQLC generates type-safe queries to the database. Docker Compose allows for a simple deployment and the ability to scale later by developing with containers in mind.
